After recent consolidation of reports/, need to audit the entire docs/ structure for consistency and gaps.\n\n## Objectives\n\n### 1. Inventory \u0026 Audit\n- Review all documentation in docs/:\n  - docs/README.md (main hub)\n  - docs/guides/\n  - docs/reference/\n  - docs/procedures/\n  - docs/applications/\n  - docs/adr/\n  - docs/reports/ (recently consolidated ✅)\n  - docs/troubleshooting/\n  - Root-level docs (CLAUDE.md, WORKFLOW.md, etc.)\n\n- Identify:\n  - Duplicate information\n  - Outdated content\n  - Missing documentation\n  - Broken internal links\n  - Inconsistent formatting\n\n### 2. Consolidation Opportunities\n- Check for overlapping content between:\n  - docs/guides/ vs docs/procedures/\n  - docs/reference/ vs docs/applications/\n  - Root-level READMEs vs docs/README.md\n- Merge or cross-reference as appropriate\n- Follow DRY principle (single source of truth)\n\n### 3. Documentation Gaps\n- Verify all applications in apps/ have docs in docs/applications/\n- Check that all ADRs are referenced in docs/adr/README.md\n- Ensure all guides have corresponding reference documentation\n- Validate troubleshooting guides cover common issues\n\n### 4. Link Validation\n- Check all internal links (markdown references)\n- Verify cross-references between documents\n- Update any broken links from recent restructuring\n- Consider adding link checker to CI/CD\n\n### 5. Consistency\n- Standardize markdown formatting:\n  - Heading hierarchy (H1 for titles, H2 for sections)\n  - Code block language tags\n  - Table formatting\n  - List styles (- vs *)\n- Consistent frontmatter where applicable\n- Uniform \"Last Updated\" dates format\n\n### 6. Navigation\n- Update docs/README.md if structure changes\n- Ensure clear navigation paths\n- Add breadcrumbs where helpful\n- Consider table of contents for long documents\n\n## Deliverables\n\n- [ ] Documentation audit report (list of issues found)\n- [ ] Consolidated/merged documents (track what was removed)\n- [ ] Updated docs/README.md with accurate structure\n- [ ] Fixed broken links\n- [ ] Identified missing documentation (create follow-up tasks)\n- [ ] Updated \"Last Updated\" dates on modified files\n\n## Out of Scope\n\n- Writing new application documentation (separate tasks)\n- Major content rewrites (focus on structure/organization)\n- Translation (French/English consistency - defer to later)\n\n## References\n\n- docs/README.md\n- docs/DOCUMENTATION-HIERARCHY.md\n- Recent reports consolidation (STATUS.md, STATE-*.md)","notes":"PHASE:6\\nDEPLOYED: 2026-01-12T12:34:12+01:00\\nVALIDATION OK: CI Passed\\nPR #629 Merged.

Should be automated where possible.\n\n## Objectives\n\nCreate scripts in scripts/ to automate report generation:\n\n### 1. generate-status-report.py\n- Query cluster state (kubectl, ArgoCD API)\n- Compare ACTUAL vs DESIRED (conformity scoring)\n- Generate STATUS.md with current data\n- Detect critical issues (OOM risk, CPU throttling)\n\n### 2. generate-actual-state.py\n- Query production cluster (kubectl get pods -A with resources)\n- Fetch VPA recommendations (Goldilocks data)\n- Extract backup profiles from Litestream configs\n- Query sync waves from ArgoCD annotations\n- Generate STATE-ACTUAL.md table\n\n### 3. conformity-checker.py\n- Load STATE-DESIRED.md (parse markdown table)\n- Load STATE-ACTUAL.md (parse markdown table)\n- Compare row by row:\n  - Resource deviations (CPU/Mem req/lim)\n  - Priority class mismatches\n  - Backup profile gaps\n  - Sync wave inconsistencies\n- Output diff report with conformity score per app\n- Optionally update STATUS.md conformity column\n\n## Technical Requirements\n\n- Python 3.11+ (use uv for dependency management)\n- Dependencies: kubernetes, pyyaml, pandas, tabulate, requests\n- Use existing KUBECONFIG from environment\n- Graceful error handling (cluster unavailable, missing VPA, etc.)\n- CLI arguments for environment selection (--env dev|prod)\n- Dry-run mode (--dry-run) to preview without writing files\n\n## Deliverables\n\n- [ ] scripts/generate-status-report.py\n- [ ] scripts/generate-actual-state.py\n- [ ] scripts/conformity-checker.py\n- [ ] scripts/lib/report_utils.py (shared utilities)\n- [ ] Update scripts/README.md with usage instructions\n- [ ] Add to WORKFLOW.just (e.g., 'just reports')\n\n## References\n\n- docs/reports/STATUS.md\n- docs/reports/STATE-ACTUAL.md\n- docs/reports/STATE-DESIRED.md\n- docs/reference/APPLICATION_SCORING_MODEL.md\n- docs/reference/RESOURCE_STANDARDS.md","notes":"PHASE:6\\nDEPLOYED: 2026-01-11 (merged to main)\\nVALIDATION OK: Manual verification of scripts (just reports passed)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","assignee":"coding-agent","created_at":"2026-01-10T15:24:40Z","created_by":"root","updated_at":"2026-01-11T15:19:34Z","closed_at":"2026-01-11T15:19:34Z","close_reason":"Closed"}

Apply to DEV first\n2. Validate 24h (monitor CoreDNS restarts + timeout errors)\n3. Apply to PROD\n\n**Testing:**\n1. Apply terraform changes\n2. Restart CoreDNS pods: kubectl rollout restart -n kube-system deployment/coredns\n3. Monitor CoreDNS logs: kubectl logs -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns --tail=50 -f\n4. Verify timeout errors stop: kubectl logs -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns --tail=200 | grep timeout | wc -l (should be 0)\n5.
