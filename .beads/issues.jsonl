Consolidation Opportunities\n- Check for overlapping content between:\n  - docs/guides/ vs docs/procedures/\n  - docs/reference/ vs docs/applications/\n  - Root-level READMEs vs docs/README.md\n- Merge or cross-reference as appropriate\n- Follow DRY principle (single source of truth)\n\n### 3. Documentation Gaps\n- Verify all applications in apps/ have docs in docs/applications/\n- Check that all ADRs are referenced in docs/adr/README.md\n- Ensure all guides have corresponding reference documentation\n- Validate troubleshooting guides cover common issues\n\n### 4. Link Validation\n- Check all internal links (markdown references)\n- Verify cross-references between documents\n- Update any broken links from recent restructuring\n- Consider adding link checker to CI/CD\n\n### 5. Consistency\n- Standardize markdown formatting:\n  - Heading hierarchy (H1 for titles, H2 for sections)\n  - Code block language tags\n  - Table formatting\n  - List styles (- vs *)\n- Consistent frontmatter where applicable\n- Uniform \"Last Updated\" dates format\n\n### 6. Navigation\n- Update docs/README.md if structure changes\n- Ensure clear navigation paths\n- Add breadcrumbs where helpful\n- Consider table of contents for long documents\n\n## Deliverables\n\n- [ ] Documentation audit report (list of issues found)\n- [ ] Consolidated/merged documents (track what was removed)\n- [ ] Updated docs/README.md with accurate structure\n- [ ] Fixed broken links\n- [ ] Identified missing documentation (create follow-up tasks)\n- [ ] Updated \"Last Updated\" dates on modified files\n\n## Out of Scope\n\n- Writing new application documentation (separate tasks)\n- Major content rewrites (focus on structure/organization)\n- Translation (French/English consistency - defer to later)\n\n## References\n\n- docs/README.md\n- docs/DOCUMENTATION-HIERARCHY.md\n- Recent reports consolidation (STATUS.md, STATE-*.md)","notes":"PHASE:6\\nDEPLOYED: 2026-01-12T12:34:12+01:00\\nVALIDATION OK: CI Passed\\nPR #629 Merged.
