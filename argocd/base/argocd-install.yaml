# ArgoCD installation is managed by Terraform
# (/root/terravixens/terraform/environments/dev/argocd.tf)
# This file is kept for reference and future GitOps self-management (Sprint 4+)
#
# Currently ArgoCD is deployed via:
#   terraform apply -target=helm_release.argocd
#
# Future: ArgoCD will manage itself via this manifest when we implement
# the App-of-Apps pattern with root-app.yaml
