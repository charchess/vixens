# Instructions for AI Assistants (Cline/Roo-Cline)

This project uses a centralized workflow management system.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Please refer to the following files for complete instructions:

1. **[WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md)** - MASTER workflow reference (supersedes all other instructions)
2. **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** - General guidelines and tool configuration
3. **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** - Archon MCP integration details

## Quick Start

1. Read [WORKFLOW.md](WORKFLOW.md) FIRST
2. Follow the task prioritization: review > doing > todo
3. Use Archon MCP for task management (NOT local tools)
4. Validate with Playwright for all web applications

In case of any conflict between instructions, **WORKFLOW.md always wins**.
